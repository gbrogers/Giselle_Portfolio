title: Drinkz!
description: Drinkz! is a web application using Vanilla Javascript and makes Axios calls to a Cocktail DB API, which is an external open source API that generates cocktail recipes. This application has four main features, allowing users to search drinks my name, alcohol type, cocktail glass type, and finally the user can generate a random cocktail recipe to try if they're feeling risky. This was my first web application, after only 8 weeks of studying code.  Application is deployed on Heroku.

title: My Body My Health
description: My Body My Health is a full stack web application that assists users in tracking their menstrual cycles and their contraceptive use. I use a custom RESTful API to perform standard CRUD operations and also make Axios requests to a Health.gov external API to retrieve verified health resources for user exploration.
